Spawn platforms by left clicking the screen. Press space to spawn your Moon Lander! Fly around and try and land on the 
platforms. If you land to hard, at too much of an angle or too fast moving horizontally, you will crash.
You can adjust the gravity, power and solar wind in the corner of the screen.
